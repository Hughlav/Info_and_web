    This project was to build a build a search engine with lucene using a corpus of documents from a CRAN collection. 
    The engine was then evaluated against a number of queries which I have the ground truth in the QRelsCorrectedforTRECeval file.
    It was build as course work for my "Information retrieval and web search" module.
